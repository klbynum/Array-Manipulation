A lot of the times when we create a program that needs to get multiple inputs from a user, we may make one(you can get multiple values using a loop)
or multiple (if the number of inputs is known) variable(s) to get the inputs that belong in the same category.
For example, we might make a program to get the number of grades from a user. What if the user has 20 or more grades that would like to enter?
We could create multiple variables or we could create a loop to keep getting the numbers until the last number is read. Doing both of these, how would we store the data?
This is where an Array comes in to play. Instead of making one or multiple variables, we could use an Array which will store the numbers and manipulate them.

This program was made to show some of the manipulations you can do with Arrays. 
In this program, tweleve numbers are placed in an array. They are then display, some numbers in the Array are changed (depending on it's value), displayed backwards, etc.
This program also takes a special number entered by a user and displays all the numbers in the array that is greater than the special number entered by the user. 
You will also find that this program is broken up into function (main, and two defined function). The use of functions is used so that the main function does not look
complicated.
